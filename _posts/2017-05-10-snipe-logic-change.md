Hey there, Its **Lord Haji** here, you might have heard about my name if your are a NecroBot user, yeah I am one of the developers of NecroBot, assuming that when you are reading this you must be very much aware of the fantastic technique called Sniping but recently due to one Niantic's server side change (An attempt to stop all sorts of cheaters) we were all getting softbanned immediately when we perform sniping.


# Meaning of Sniping (Technique/Convention we used)

* **Step I:**  Jump to target Pokémon's coordinates. (and wait for a few secs for it to spawn as usual)
* **Step II:**  Encounter it (Meaning :- As simple as is like in your phone when you tap on a Pokémon on the Pokémon GO App and it says "A wild ... appeared")
* **Step III:** Jump back to the original coordinates you had started off with.(to prevent softban)
* **Step IV:** Catch it with your preferred PokéBall(s), and boom you are able to catch that specific Pokémon.(sometimes even failed if your luck is bad enough :P)

But the thing happening for the last few days was the immediate moment you did jump back to your original coordinates you would get softbanned and possibly get your account flagged.

Thankfully we were successful in discovering **two** new techniques of sniping which seem to work.


# Method #1

* **Step I:**  Jump to target Pokémon's coordinates.
* **Step II:**  Encounter it.
* **Step III:** Catch it with your preferred PokéBall(s) (..... xD)
* **Step IV:** Jump back to your original location (coordinates)

# Method #2

* **Step I:**  Jump to target Pokémon's coordinates.
* **Step II:**  Encounter it.
* **Step III:** Catch it with your preferred PokéBall(s)
* **Step IV:** Never jump back (At least for the time being xD)

These two methods seem to work but our Dev team will continue to research more about it.
We will soon add the support for this sniping technique for NecroBot

**P.S:** These methods are not 100 % confirmed although they seem to work

Will keep you guys updated with further snipe news follow me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Lord_Haji) for regular updates
